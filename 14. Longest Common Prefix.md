## Problem: [14. Longest Common Prefix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-prefix/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
**

---

### Description:
Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

---

### Approach:
Took the first string as the initial prefix, then iterated through the rest, character by character.
Reduced the common prefix length (sz) whenever a mismatch occurred.
This avoids building new strings repeatedly and is space-efficient.
- **Time Complexity:** O(m*n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string longestCommonPrefix(vector<string>& strs) {
        string ans = strs[0];
        int sz = ans.size();
        for (const string& c : strs) {
            for (int i = 0; i < sz; ++i) {
                if (i >= c.size() || c[i] != ans[i]) {
                    sz = i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        return ans.substr(0, sz);
    }
};
```
