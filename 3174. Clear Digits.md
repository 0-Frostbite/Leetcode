## Problem: [3174. Clear Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/clear-digits/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*String | Stack | Simulation*

---

### Description:
For a given string s, remove every digit and the letter to its left and return the final string.

---

### Approach:
We can operate the string result as a stack by adding and removing into it while iterating from left to right.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string clearDigits(string s) {
        string stack;
        for (char c : s) {
            if (isdigit(c)) {
                if (!stack.empty()) stack.pop_back();
            } else {
                stack.push_back(c);
            }
        }
        return stack;
    }
};
```
