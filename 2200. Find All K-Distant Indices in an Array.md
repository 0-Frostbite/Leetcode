## Problem: [2200. Find All K-Distant Indices in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-k-distant-indices-in-an-array)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Two Pointers*

---

### Description:
Given an Integer Array **nums** and integers **key** and **k**, return an array of indices such that nums`[i]` is equal to key and nums`[j]` is number such that |i-j| = k. The indices should be in ascending order and shoud not repeat.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**

The quesetion is hard to understand because of the wordings however we simply need to return an array of indices in k range around the index with value key. Say, nums`[i]` = key so we add the indices from i-k to i+k to the result.Key things here are to check if i-k is less than 0 and if i-k is already added to the array. The later is handled by using a variable to store last added index. 

- **What approach did I use and why?**

Set variable for last accessed index as -1. Then iterate over the indices, if it matches the key add the indices from maximum of index-k and last index to minimum of index+k and array.size()-1.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findKDistantIndices(vector<int>& nums, int key, int k) {
        int n = nums.size();
        vector<int> result;
        int lastAdded = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] == key) {
                int start = max(i - k, lastAdded + 1);
                int end = min(i + k, n - 1);
                for (int j = start; j <= end; ++j) {
                    result.push_back(j);
                }
                lastAdded = end;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
