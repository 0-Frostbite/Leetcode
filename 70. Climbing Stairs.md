## Problem: [70. Climbing Stairs](https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math | Programming | Memoization*

---

### Description:
You can take 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given an integer n which represents the number of steps, return the total number of ways to reach the end.

---

### Approach:
Used bottom-up dynamic programming with space optimization: Instead of storing all previous states, just kept track of the last two (sec_prev, last_prev). The recurrence is: f(n) = f(n-1) + f(n-2) â€” representing choices to reach current stair from 1 or 2 steps below.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;

        int sec_prev = 1, last_prev = 2, curr = 0;
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            curr = last_prev + sec_prev;
            sec_prev = last_prev;
            last_prev = curr;
        }

        return curr;
    }
};
```
