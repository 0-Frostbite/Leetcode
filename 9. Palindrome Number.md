## Problem: [9. Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math*

---

### Description:
Return true or false based on whether the number is a palindrome or not.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**

I planned on solving it by getting the size of the int using log10() and dividing the number by 10 to power its size to get the Most significant digit and compare it with the Least significant digit. However using log and division so often is performance heavy and requires additional bug fixes.

- **What approach did I use and why?**

We split the number into equal parts and check if they are equal. This is achieved by dividing the integer by 10 and adding the remainder to a variable as long as the variable is smaller than the integer. If the variable become larger its not a palindrom otherwise it is.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPalindrome(int x) {
        // Negative numbers and numbers ending in 0 (but not 0 itself) are not palindromes
        if (x < 0 || (x % 10 == 0 && x != 0)) return false;

        int reversed = 0;
        while (x > reversed) {
            reversed = reversed * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }

        // For even digits: x == reversed
        // For odd digits: x == reversed / 10 (middle digit ignored)
        return (x == reversed || x == reversed / 10);
    }
};
```
