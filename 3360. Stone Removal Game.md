## Problem: [3360. Stone Removal Game](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-removal-game/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math | Simulation*

---

### Description:
Alice and Bob are playing a game where they take turns removing stones from a pile, with Alice going first. Alice starts by removing exactly 10 stones on her first turn. For each subsequent turn, each player removes exactly 1 fewer stone than the previous opponent. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Given a positive integer n, return true if Alice wins the game and false otherwise.

---

### Approach:
Alice always gets even values and Bob always get odd values. So we keep subtracting the move size from the number and when the number becomes 0, we check the divisibility of move size to find who won.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool canAliceWin(int n) {
        int x = 10;
        while (n >= x) {
            n -= x--;
        }
        return (x % 2) == 1;
    }
};
```
