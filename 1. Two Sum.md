## Problem: [1. Two Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Hash Table*

---

### Description:
Given an integer array and a target number find two numbers in the array such that there sum is equal to target number.

---

### Approach:
Firstly a Hash Table was used to store all the values and there index(es). We then iterate over the array and lookup the result of subtracting i from target. We check if the Hash Table has the value and that its index is greater than that of i. Upon finding a match i.e. the we return the indices. 
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> twoSum(vector<int>& nums, int target) {
        unordered_map<int, int> map;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); ++i) {
            int complement = target - nums[i];
            auto it = map.find(complement);
            if (it != map.end()) {
                return {i, it->second};
            }
            map[nums[i]] = i;
        }
        return {-1, -1};
    }
};
```
