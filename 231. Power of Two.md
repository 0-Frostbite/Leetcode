## Problem: [231. Power of Two](https://leetcode.com/problems/power-of-two/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Math | Bit Manipulation | Recursion*

---

### Description:
Given an integer, return whether the number is a power of two or not.

---

### Approach:
A number n is a power of two if and only if n > 0 and n & (n - 1) == 0
Example:8 in binary → 1000; 7 in binary → 0111; 8 & 7 = 0
This is the most efficient way to check for power of two.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        if (n < 1) return false;
        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
};
```
