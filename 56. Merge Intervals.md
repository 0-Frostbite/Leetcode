## Problem: [56. Merge Intervals](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-intervals/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Array | Sorting*

---

### Description:
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [starti, endi], merge all overlapping intervals, and return an array of the non-overlapping intervals that cover all the intervals in the input.

---

### Approach:
This is a classic in-place two-pointer approach:
- Sort intervals by start time.
- Use index as a write pointer to keep track of the last valid merged interval.
For each interval:
- If it overlaps with the interval at index, merge it.
- If not, move index forward and write the current interval there.
Resize the intervals array to index + 1 to trim unused space.
- **Time Complexity:** O(nlogn)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> merge(vector<vector<int>>& intervals) {
        sort(intervals.begin(), intervals.end());

        int index = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.size(); ++i) {
            if (intervals[i][0] <= intervals[index][1]) {
                intervals[index][1] = max(intervals[index][1], intervals[i][1]);
            } else {
                ++index;
                intervals[index] = intervals[i];
            }
        }

        intervals.resize(index + 1);
        return intervals;
    }
};
```
