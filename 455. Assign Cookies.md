## Problem: [455. Assign Cookies](https://leetcode.com/problems/assign-cookies/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Two Pointers | Greedy | Sorting*

---

### Description:
Given two integer arrays G and S match the elements such that G(i)<=S(i). Return the maximum possible matches.

---

### Approach:
Used a greedy + two-pointer strategy. Sorted both g (children's greed) and s (cookie sizes).
For each cookie, if it satisfies the current child's greed, we assign it and move to the next child.
This ensures the maximum number of content children while minimizing wasted cookie size.
- **Time Complexity:** O(nlogn + mlogm)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findContentChildren(vector<int>& g, vector<int>& s) {
        sort(g.begin(), g.end());
        sort(s.begin(), s.end());

        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.size() && j < g.size()) {
            if (g[j] <= s[i]) {
                j++;  // child is satisfied
            }
            i++;  // move to next cookie
        }
        return j;
    }
};
```
