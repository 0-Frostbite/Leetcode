## Problem: [1695. Maximum Erasure Value](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-erasure-value/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Array | Hash Table | Sliding Window*

---

### Description:
Given an array of positive integers, return the sum of elements inside the subarray which has no duplicate elements.

---

### Approach:
Initially used a set to track elements in the current window, but insertion and deletion were costly due to O(log n) operations. Then moved to a unordered_set (hashmap-based) which improved performance but still had some overhead.  
Final optimized solution uses a fixed-size vector<bool> as a presence table (since values are bounded â‰¤ 100,000), enabling constant-time checks and updates. This drastically reduces overhead and improves performance.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) fixed size vector of 100001 elements.

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maximumUniqueSubarray(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<bool> table(100001, false);
        int L = 0, R = 0, sum = 0, t_sum = 0;

        while (R < nums.size()) {
            if (!table[nums[R]]) {
                t_sum += nums[R];
                table[nums[R]] = true;
                R++;
            } else {
                t_sum -= nums[L];
                table[nums[L]] = false;
                L++;
            }
            sum = max(sum, t_sum);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
