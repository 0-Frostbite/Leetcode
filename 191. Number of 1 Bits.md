## Problem: [191. Number of 1 Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-1-bits/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Divide and Conquer | Bit Manipulation*

---

### Description:
Given a positive integer return the number of 1's in its binary format.

---

### Approach:
**Approach 1:** We can use num AND 1 to check if the LSB is 1 and then right shift the number. 
**Approach 2: (Brian Kernighan's Algorithm)** Instead of checking each bit one by one, we remove the rightmost set bit (the least significant 1) in each iteration until the number becomes 0. This is done using the formula n&=(n-1). Subtracting 1 from a number flips the rightmost set bit to 0 and all the bits to the right of it to 1. When you do n & (n - 1), it clears that rightmost set bit.
- **Time Complexity:** O(x), number of set bits.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n) {
            n &= (n - 1);
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
