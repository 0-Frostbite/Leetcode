### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:

---

### Description:
You are given a string s. The score of a string is defined as the sum of the absolute difference between the ASCII values of adjacent characters.
Return the score of s.

---

### Approach:
Simply iterate over the string from 0 to size-1 and add the absolute value of the n and n+1 char to the sum. Return the sum
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int scoreOfString(string s) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i=0 ; i<s.size()-1 ;i++) {
            sum+=abs(s[i]-s[i+1]);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
