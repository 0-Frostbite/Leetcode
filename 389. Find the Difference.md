## Problem: [389. Find the Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-difference/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Hash Table | String | Bit Manipulation | Sorting*

---

### Description:
Given two strings s and t, where t has a extra letter and is shuffled return the extra letter.

---

### Approach:
XOR all characters in s from the total, and add all characters from t.
Since t has one extra character, the XOR between the total sums directly gives the extra character.
This is faster and cleaner than using a hash map or frequency array.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the size of smaller array (s).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            sum ^= s[i];
            sum ^= t[i];
        }
        sum ^= t.back(); // add the extra character
        return (char)sum;
    }
};
```
