## Problem: [3190. Find Minimum Operations to Make All Elements Divisible by Three](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-operations-to-make-all-elements-divisible-by-three/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Math*

---

### Description:
Given an array of integers return the number of operations needed to make all the numbers divisible by 3.

---

### Approach:
We can simply check of divisibilty and add 1 to number of operations if its not divisble because if a number is not divisible by 3 be can make it divisible simply by adding or subtracting 1. (Ex- 4 - 1 = 3 and 5 + 1 = 6)
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int minimumOperations(vector<int>& nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (auto i : nums) {
            if (i%3!=0) sum++;
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
