## Problem: [12. Integer to Roman](https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-to-roman/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Hash Table | Math | String*

---

### Description:
Convert and Integer to Roman number.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**

In decreasing order of value of roman number compare it to the number. If the number is greater subtract that value and add to the roman value. We must also take in consideration the special case like 4,9,40,90,400,900 

- **What approach did I use and why?**

We used greedy matching with predefined arrays of Roman numeral values and their corresponding symbols. This way we can eliminate the heavy if else use and constant checks. The approach is more elegant, visually and logically.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) considering the range 1 to 3999. 
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string intToRoman(int num) {
        const int values[] =     {1000,  900, 500, 400, 100,  90,  50,  40,  10,   9,   5,   4,   1};
        const string symbols[] = {"M", "CM", "D","CD", "C","XC", "L","XL", "X","IX", "V","IV", "I"};

        string roman;
        for (int i = 0; i < 13 && num > 0; ++i) {
            while (num >= values[i]) {
                num -= values[i];
                roman += symbols[i];
            }
        }
        return roman;
    }
};
```
