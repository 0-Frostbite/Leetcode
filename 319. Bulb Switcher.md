## Problem: [319. Bulb Switcher](https://leetcode.com/problems/bulb-switcher/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Math | Brainteaser*

---

### Description:
There are n bulbs where every second bulb is turned off. For every i <= n the bulb at ith multiple is toggled. Return the number of bulbs that are turned on in the end.

---

### Approach:
The key observation is that:
- A bulb ends up on only if it is toggled an odd number of times.
- A bulb is toggled once for every divisor.
Only perfect squares have an odd number of divisors. So the answer is simply the count of perfect squares ≤ n, i.e., ⌊√n⌋.
- **Time Complexity:** O(√n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int bulbSwitch(int n) {
        return sqrt(n);
    }
};
```
