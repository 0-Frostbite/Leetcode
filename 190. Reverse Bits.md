## Problem: [190. Reverse Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-bits/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Divide and Conquer | Bit Manipulation*

---

### Description:
Given a 32 bits integers reverse its bits (not flip) and return the value.

---

### Approach:
Using bit manipulation left-shift the result and extract bits from the original number one by one from the left using n&1 to compare the LSB.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverseBits(int n) {
        int m = 0;
        int count = 32;
        while (count > 0) {
            m<<=1;
            m+=(n&1);
            n>>=1;
            count--;
        }
        return m;
    }
};
```
