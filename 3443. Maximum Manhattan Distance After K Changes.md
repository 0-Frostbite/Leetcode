### Description:
Given a set of movements {N,S,E,W} and a number k. Find the maximum achieveable manhattan distance at any point after swapping at most k indexes in the set with a value, given we start from origin.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**
    We can find the index with highest distance and also swap index if possible (if it all 'N' we cant change an element to increase the result. However if we have 3'N' and a 'S' with k=1 we change 'S' to 'N' to increase the maximum number.) This way the final result is the maximumm manhattan distance from the origin.
- **What approach did I use and why?**
    We use a variable maximum to store the highest possible manhattan distance from origin, x and y to store the current distance from origin. Multiply k by 2 (because doing a change is essentialy removing the -1 and also adding a +1 i.e. doing causes 2 times the movement. Ex: 'N','S','N' k=0 its 1(+1,-1,+1) and with k=1 its 3). We iterate over the set and add to x and y respectively. At each instance we check if the distance is more than the maximum (abs(x) + abs(y) + min(k, i + 1 - abs(x) - abs(y))).This formula calculates the number of changeable values by subtracting the sum of values of axis by length of set till then. We take the minimum of the value and k and add it to absolute value of x and y. If this manhattan distanceis greater then the maximum this becomes the new maximum. Either way we continue till the end.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDistance(string s, int k) {
        int maxx = 0;
        int y = 0, x = 0; // y for N/S, x for W/E
        k*=2;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            switch (s[i]) {
                case 'N': ++y; break;
                case 'S': --y; break;
                case 'W': ++x; break;
                case 'E': --x; break;
            }
            const int boosted = abs(x) + abs(y) + min(k, (i + 1 - abs(x) - abs(y)));
            if (boosted > maxx) maxx = boosted;
        }
        return maxx;
    }
};
```
