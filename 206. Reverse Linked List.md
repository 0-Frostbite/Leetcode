## Problem: [206. Reverse Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-linked-list/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Linked List | Recursion*

---

### Description:
Given the head of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the reversed list.

---

### Approach:
Used iterative pointer manipulation:
- l tracks the previous node (initially nullptr)
- m is the current node being processed
- r temporarily stores the next node
Reversed each next pointer and moved forward, in-place. This is the most efficient and standard method for reversing a singly linked list.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* reverseList(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* prev = nullptr;
        ListNode* curr = head;

        while (curr) {
            ListNode* next = curr->next; // save next
            curr->next = prev;           // reverse
            prev = curr;                 // move prev forward
            curr = next;                 // move curr forward
        }

        return prev;
    }
};
```
