## Problem: [2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-hills-and-valleys-in-an-array/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array*

---

### Description:
If the non-equal neigbours of the elemnts are both greater or less then add to count and return the final count.

---

### Approach:
Used a single loop with a pointer left to track the last non-equal value to the left. For each element, checked if it is greater than both neighbors (hill) or less than both neighbors (valley). Skipped consecutive duplicates implicitly by keeping left only when a hill/valley is detected.
This ensures clean detection of actual terrain changes.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countHillValley(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int left = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.size() - 1; ++i) {
            if ((nums[i] > nums[left] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) ||
                (nums[i] < nums[left] && nums[i] < nums[i + 1])) {
                count++;
                left = i;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};

```
