## Problem: [2. Add Two Numbers](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-two-numbers)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Linked List | Math | Recursion*

---

### Description:
Given two linked lists each representing digits within a number add them together and return the new linked list representing their sum.  

---

### Approach:
Since each node represent a digit it cant be greater than 9 so we need a variable to store the carry. As long as a linked list node exists we add its value to the new list node along with the carry. We then take the carry if value comes out greater than 9. Go to the next node in existing linked list nodes and create a new node for or result linked list.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* addTwoNumbers(ListNode* l1, ListNode* l2) {
        ListNode dummy(0);
        ListNode* curr = &dummy;
        int carry = 0;

        while (l1 || l2 || carry) {
            int sum = carry;

            if (l1) {
                sum += l1->val;
                l1 = l1->next;
            }

            if (l2) {
                sum += l2->val;
                l2 = l2->next;
            }

            carry = sum / 10;
            curr->next = new ListNode(sum % 10);
            curr = curr->next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```
