## Problem: [204. Count Primes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-primes/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Array | Math | Enumeration | Number Theory*

---

### Description:
Given an integer n, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than n.

---

### Approach:
Created a sieve boolean array where sieve(i) = true implies i is prime.
Started from 2, and for each prime, marked its multiples as not prime (false). Counted how many true values remained â€” these are the primes less than n.
This is the most efficient method for counting primes up to n.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countPrimes(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return 0;

        vector<bool> sieve(n, true);
        sieve[0] = sieve[1] = false;
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 2; i * i < n; ++i) {
            if (sieve[i]) {
                for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
                    sieve[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }

        for (bool isPrime : sieve) {
            if (isPrime) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }
};
```
