## Problem: [1290. Convert Binary Number in a Linked List to Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-binary-number-in-a-linked-list-to-integer/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Linked List | Math*

---

### Description:
Given a Linked List represting the digits of a number in binary return the number in decimal.

---

### Approach:
Used bit shifting to convert the binary representation to decimal.
At each node, left-shift the result (count <<= 1) and add the current bit.
This mimics binary number formation and is optimal in time and space for a singly linked list.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int getDecimalValue(ListNode* head) {
        int count = 0;
        while (head) {
            count = (count << 1) + head->val;
            head = head->next;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
