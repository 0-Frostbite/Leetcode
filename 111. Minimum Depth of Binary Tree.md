## Problem: [111. Minimum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Tree | DFS | BFS | Binary Tree*
---

### Description:
Given a Binary tree find the leaf node with the minimum depth and return its distance from root.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**
    The question can be solved using both BFS and DFS however BFS is performant because we dont go through all the nodes in an average case. Unlike in DFS where it explores all the paths.
- **What approach did I use and why?**
    We used the basic BFS method however instead of storing just the node we also store its level (distance from root). As soon as we find a leaf node we return its level.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
  int minDepth(TreeNode *root) {
    if (!root) {
      return 0;
    }

    std::queue<std::pair<TreeNode *, int>> q;
    q.push({root, 1});

    while (!q.empty()) {
      TreeNode *node = q.front().first;
      int depth = q.front().second;

      q.pop();

      if (!node->left && !node->right) {
        root->left = nullptr;
        root->right = nullptr;
        return depth;
      }

      if (node->left) {
        q.push({node->left, depth + 1});
      }

      if (node->right) {
        q.push({node->right, depth + 1});
      }
    }

    return 0;
  }
};
```
