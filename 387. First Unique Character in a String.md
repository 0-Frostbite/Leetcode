## Problem: [387. First Unique Character in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/first-unique-character-in-a-string/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Hash Table | String | Queue | Counting*

---

### Description:
Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return -1.

---

### Approach:
Used a fixed-size frequency array (vector<int>) of size 26 (since input is lowercase only).
First pass counts the frequency, second pass finds the first character with frequency 1.
This is optimal in both time and space for the problem c
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int firstUniqChar(string s) {
        vector<int> freq(26, 0);
        for (char ch : s) {
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size(); ++i) {
            if (freq[s[i] - 'a'] == 1) return i;
        }
        return -1;
    }
};
```
