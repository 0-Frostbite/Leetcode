## Problem: [7. Reverse Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-integer/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Math*

---

### Description:
Given an integer return it in reverse. If reversing causes overflow for int32 return 0.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**

We can use a long long to check if the number reverse number overflows. The number can be reversed using a math formula.

- **What approach did I use and why?**

Divide integer by 10, multiply result by 10 and add the remainder of integer to it. Do this until interger becomes 0.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int reverse(int x) {
       long long rev=0;
       while(x!=0){
            rev=rev*10+x%10;
            x/=10;
       }
       if(rev>INT_MIN && rev<=INT_MAX)
       return rev;
       else return 0;
    }
};
```
