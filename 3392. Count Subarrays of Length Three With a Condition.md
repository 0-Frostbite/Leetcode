## Problem: [3392. Count Subarrays of Length Three With a Condition](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-subarrays-of-length-three-with-a-condition/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array*

---

### Description:
Given an integer array nums, return the number of of length 3 such that the sum of the first and third numbers equals exactly half of the second number.

---

### Approach:
Use the formula and iterate over the array to find the total valid subarrays.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countSubarrays(vector<int>& nums) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i=0 ; i<=nums.size()-3 ; i++) {
            if ((nums[i]+nums[i+2])*2 == nums[i+1]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
