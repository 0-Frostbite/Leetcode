## Problem: [75. Sort Colors](https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-colors/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Array | Two Pointers | Sorting*

---

### Description:
Given an array marked with 3 colors (0,1,2) sort them in place.

---

### Approach:
**What did I think first?** Count the occurrences of 0s, 1s, and 2s and rebuild the array. Uses two passes one to read and one to write.  
**What approach did I use and why?**  
Used the Dutch National Flag algorithm for in-place sorting with one pass.
Maintained three regions: [0, lo-1] for 0s, [lo, mid-1] for 1s, and [hi+1, end] for 2s.  
Swapped elements based on value at mid and adjusted pointers.
This is the most optimal solution without extra space.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void sortColors(vector<int>& arr) {
        // Dutch Flag Algo
        int lo = 0, mid = 0;
        int hi = arr.size()-1;

        while (mid <= hi) {
            if (arr[mid] == 0)
                swap(arr[lo++], arr[mid++]);
            else if (arr[mid] == 1)
                mid++;
            else
                swap(arr[mid], arr[hi--]);
        }
    }
};
```
