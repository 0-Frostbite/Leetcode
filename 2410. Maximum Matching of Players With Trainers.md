## Problem: [2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-matchinf-of-players-with-trainers/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Array | Two Pointer | Greedy | Sorting*

---

### Description:
Given the strings players and trainers where each element represents their training capability.
A trainer can only match with players with capability less than or equal to theirs.
Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers that satisfy these conditions.

---

### Approach:
Sorted both players and trainers. Then used two pointers to iterate through both lists and tried to match each player to the smallest trainer that satisfies the condition. This greedy + sorting approach guarantees maximum valid pairings with optimal efficiency.
- **Time Complexity:** O(nlogn + mlogm)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int matchPlayersAndTrainers(vector<int>& players, vector<int>& trainers) {
        int i = 0, j = 0, cnt = 0;
        sort(begin(players), end(players));
        sort(begin(trainers), end(trainers));

        while (i < players.size() && j < trainers.size()) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                cnt++;
                i++;
            }
            j++;
        }
        return cnt;
    }
};
```
