## Problem: [3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-number-of-distinct-colors-among-the-balls/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Array | Hash Table | Simulation*

---

### Description:
Given a 2D array of length x,made up of a pair of numbers {x,y} representing the index and color of the ball at that index. There are at most x indices and x+1 colors. Return total unique colors being used at a given instance.

---

### Approach:
Because the Color and the Index can have very large number and are not in a series we cannot use a vector. So, we use two maps.
  - Store the Color and its number of occurences.
  - Store the index and its Color.
We also used a variable to store the count of unique colors at eacch instance so we dont have to recalculate at each iteration. For each {index , color} in the 2D Array, we -
  - Remove one occurence of the previous color by looking up table to find color and remove count, if the old color's count was one we remove 1 from unique count because the color is no longer in use.
  - Add one occurence of the new color by changing the entry and adding one to the count of the color, if the new color's count is 1 we add one to unique count because a new color has been used.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> queryResults(int limit, vector<vector<int>>& queries) {
        unordered_map<int, int> indexToColor;  // maps index -> color
        unordered_map<int, int> colorCount;    // maps color -> frequency
        vector<int> result;
        int unique = 0;

        for (const auto& q : queries) {
            int index = q[0];
            int newColor = q[1];
            // Get current color of the index, default is 0 (not colored)
            int oldColor = indexToColor.count(index) ? indexToColor[index] : -1;
            // If index had a color before, decrease its count
            if (oldColor != -1) {
                if (--colorCount[oldColor] == 0) {
                    unique--;
                }
            }
            // If this color was unused before, increase unique
            if (++colorCount[newColor] == 1) {
                unique++;
            }
            // Assign new color
            indexToColor[index] = newColor;

            result.push_back(unique);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
