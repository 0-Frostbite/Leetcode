## Problem: [3423. Maximum Difference Between Adjacent Elements in a Circular Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-adjacent-elements-in-a-circular-array/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array*

---

### Description:
Given a circular array nums, find the maximum absolute difference between adjacent elements.

---

### Approach:
Since its an array we cant compare the first and last element during iteration. We check this separately and iteratively check for the consdecutive indices in the list.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxAdjacentDistance(vector<int>& nums) {
        int n=nums.size();
        int ans = abs(nums[0] - nums[n - 1]);
        for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++){
           ans=max(ans, abs(nums[i+1]-nums[i]));
        }
        return ans;
    }
};
```
