## Problem: [3146. Permutation Difference between Two Strings](https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-difference-between-two-strings/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Hash Table | String*

---

### Description:
Given two string s and t consisting only of character, return the sum of absolute value of s.index(S) - t.index(S) for each S in s.

---

### Approach:
The size of s and t is know and very small (26), so we can store the index of s in a vector of size 26 this will act as a hash table. We can use the hash table to look up values in t and calculte the result.  
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findPermutationDifference(string s, string t) {
        vector<int> map(26);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i=0 ; i<s.size() ; ++i) {
            map[s[i]-'a'] = i;
        }
        for (int i=0 ; i<t.size() ; ++i) {
            sum += abs(map[t[i]-'a']-i);
        }
        return sum;
    }
};
```
