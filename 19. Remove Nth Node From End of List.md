## Problem: [19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Linked List | Two Pointers*

---

### Description:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

---

### Approach:
Used the two-pointer technique with a dummy node:
- Advanced the first pointer n + 1 steps ahead
- Moved both first and second together until first reached the end
- second now points to the node before the one to delete
This method handles all edge cases (like deleting the head) without needing to know the list length.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* removeNthFromEnd(ListNode* head, int n) {
        ListNode dummy(0, head);
        ListNode* first = &dummy;
        ListNode* second = &dummy;

        // Move first n+1 steps ahead
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            first = first->next;
        }

        // Move both until first reaches the end
        while (first) {
            first = first->next;
            second = second->next;
        }

        // Delete the target node
        ListNode* toDelete = second->next;
        second->next = second->next->next;
        delete toDelete;

        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```
