## Problem: [3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-without-repeating-characters)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Hash Table | String | Sliding Window*

---

### Description:
Given a string s, find the length of the longest substring without duplicate characters (english letters, digits, symbols and space).

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**

Initial I didn't consider characters outside the alphabets as I didn't fully read the statement. The initial approach involved using a Hash Table to store character and its last index, and Two Pointers to see if a character is repeating by checking the last index is greater than or equal to Left pointer. If yes, we calculate and update max length. 

- **What approach did I use and why?**

The final approach was all the same except an array of 128 length was used in place of Hash Table. This alternative proved to be lighter and faster.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLongestSubstring(string s) {
        vector<int> table(128,-1);
        int left = -1, right = 0;
        int length = 0;
        for (;right<s.size();right++) {
            
            if (table[s[right]]>=left) {

                left = table[s[right]];
            }
            length=max(length,right-left);
            // cout<<left<<" "<<right<<"|";
            table[s[right]] = right;
        }
        return length;
    }
};
```
