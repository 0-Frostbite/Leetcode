## Problem: [104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Tree | DFS | BFS | Binary Tree*

---

### Description:
Return the binary tree's maximum depth

---

### Approach:
Simple recursive method adding one to the depth on each recursion and comparing subtree for maximum depth.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), even though we have two recursive calls we are going through the whole tree only once with no repeating case. Therefore its O(n) and O(2^n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), h is the height of the tree.

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root) return 1+max(maxDepth(root->left),maxDepth(root->right));
        return 0;
    }
};
```
