## Problem: [338. Counting Bits](https://leetcode.com/problems/counting-bits/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Dynamic Programming | Bit Manipulation*

---

### Description:
Given an integer n, return an array ans of length n + 1 such that for each i (0 <= i <= n), ans(i) is the number of 1's in the binary representation of i.

---

### Approach:
Used dynamic programming based on the observation that:
- When i is a power of 2 â†’ it has exactly 1 bit set
- For numbers between powers of 2, res(i) = res(i - highestPowerOf2) + 1
1o we track the most recent power of 2 (count), and use it to calculate the rest efficiently.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> countBits(int n) {
        vector<int> res{0};
        int offset = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            if ((i & (i - 1)) == 0) offset = i;  // power of two
            res.push_back(res[i - offset] + 1);
        }

        return res;
    }
};
```
