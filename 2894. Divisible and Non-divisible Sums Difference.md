## Problem: [2894. Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference](https://leetcode.com/problems/divisible-and-non-divisible-sums-difference/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*
### Topics:
*Math*

---

### Description:
Given two integers n and m. Add all the number in range (1,n) (inclusive) not divisible by m and subtract those divisible by m.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**

The initial approach was to go through the entire range, and add or subtract from sum based on the divisibilty by m.

- **What approach did I use and why?**

The problem was solved in O(1) instead by calculating the sum of range and subtracting the sum of multiples of m in range n.

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int differenceOfSums(int n, int m) {
        int totalSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int count = n / m;
        int divSum = m * count * (count + 1) / 2;
        return totalSum - 2 * divSum;
    }
};
```
