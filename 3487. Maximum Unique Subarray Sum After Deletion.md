## Problem: [3487. Maximum Unique Subarray Sum After Deletion](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-unique-subarray-sum-after-deletion/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Hash Table | Greedy*

---

### Description:
Given an array of integers return the maximum sum you can achieve by adding selective unique elements.

---

### Approach:
Instead of using a sliding window, I iterated once through the array and used a fixed-size boolean table (0â€“100) to track duplicates. If the number was positive and not seen before, I added it to the sum. If all elements were negative, I returned the maximum (least negative) number. This eliminated overhead from hash sets or maps while still tracking uniqueness.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxSum(vector<int>& nums) {
        vector<bool> table(101,false);
        int sum = 0, neg = INT_MIN;
        bool pos = false;
        for (auto num : nums) {
            if (num>=0){
                if (!table[num]) {
                    table[num] = true;
                    sum+=num;
                    pos = true;
                }
            } else {
                neg = max(num,neg);
            }
        }
        // cout << pos << sum << neg;
        return pos?sum:neg;
    }
};
```
