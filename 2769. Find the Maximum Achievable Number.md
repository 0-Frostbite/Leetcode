## Problem: [2769. Find the Maximum Achievable Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-achievable-number)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math*

---

### Description:
Dogshit

---

### Approach:
Each operation can either add or subtract 1, so in t operations, the maximum increase is +2t. Final result is simply num + 2 * t. This is the most direct and optimal solution.
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int theMaximumAchievableX(int num, int t) {
        return num + 2 * t;
    }
};
```
