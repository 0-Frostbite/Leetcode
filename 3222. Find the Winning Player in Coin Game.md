### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Math | Simulation | Game Theory*

### Description:
You are given two positive integers x and y, denoting the number of coins with values 75 and 10 respectively. Alice and Bob are playing a game. Each turn, starting with Alice, the player must pick up coins with a total value 115. If the player is unable to do so, they lose the game. Return the name of the player who wins the game.

### Approach:
Calculate how many times 115 can be made and based on the value check who wins
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string winningPlayer(int x, int y) {
        return min(x,y/4)%2 == 0 ? "Bob" : "Alice";
    }
};
```
