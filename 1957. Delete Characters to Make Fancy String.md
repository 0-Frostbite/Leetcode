## Problem: [1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String](https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-characters-to-make-fancy-string/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*String*

---

### Description:
Given a string return a string such that the same letter in a sequence occur not more than 2 times, if they do remove them.

---

### Approach:
Used two pointers: one for reading and one (y) for writing valid characters. Only added a character to the result if it's not the same as the previous two characters. Modified the string in-place and resized it. This is optimal in both time and space.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) In-place modification

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    string makeFancyString(string s) {
        if (s.size() < 3) return s;
        int y = 2;
        for (int x = 2; x < s.size(); ++x) {
            if (s[x] != s[y - 1] || s[x] != s[y - 2]) {
                s[y++] = s[x];
            }
        }
        s.resize(y);
        return s;
    }
};
```
