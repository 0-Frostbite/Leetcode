## Problem: [21. Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Linked List | Recursion*

---

### Description:
Given two sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted list and return the head pointer.

---

### Approach:
Used a manual merge approach with a dummy pointer to iteratively attach the smaller of the current nodes from both lists. Handled edge cases where one list is empty. At the end, attached the remaining nodes of the non-empty list directly. This is the standard and optimal solution for merging two sorted linked lists.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n+m)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* mergeTwoLists(ListNode* list1, ListNode* list2) {
        ListNode dummy;
        ListNode* tail = &dummy;

        while (list1 && list2) {
            if (list1->val < list2->val) {
                tail->next = list1;
                list1 = list1->next;
            } else {
                tail->next = list2;
                list2 = list2->next;
            }
            tail = tail->next;
        }

        tail->next = list1 ? list1 : list2;
        return dummy.next;
    }
};
```
