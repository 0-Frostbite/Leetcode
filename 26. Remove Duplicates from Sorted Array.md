## Problem: [26. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Two Pointers*

---

### Description:
Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in nums.

---

### Approach:
Used two pointers: Left marks the position of the last unique element right scans forward. If a new unique element is found at right, increment left and swap it into place. This ensures that all unique elements are stored in the first k positions of the array. Final return value is left + 1, which is the new length.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int removeDuplicates(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return 0;

        int left = 0;
        for (int right = 1; right < nums.size(); ++right) {
            if (nums[right] != nums[left]) {
                ++left;
                nums[left] = nums[right];
            }
        }
        return left + 1;
    }
};
```
