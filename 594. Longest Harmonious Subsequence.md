## Problem: [594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-harmonious-subsequence/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Sliding Window | Hash Table | Sorting | Counting*

---

### Description:
Given an integer array, find the longest subsequence so that the maxmimum and minimum element have a difference of 1 and return the length. 

---

### Approach:
We basically want a list with only n and n+1 as the elements and return the length of longest such array. We can store each value and its count in a hash table and iterate over it checking for each i, if i+1 exists and the sum of there count is more then the max length achieved so far.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLHS(std::vector<int>& nums) {
        std::unordered_map<int, int> freq;
        int maxLen = 0;

        for (int num : nums)
            ++freq[num];

        for (const auto& [num, count] : freq) {
            if (freq.count(num + 1))
                maxLen = std::max(maxLen, count + freq[num + 1]);
        }
        return maxLen;
    }
};
```
