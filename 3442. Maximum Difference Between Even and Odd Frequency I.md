## Problem: [3442. Maximum Difference Between Even and Odd Frequency I
](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-even-and-odd-frequency-i/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Hash Table | String | Counting*

---

### Description:
Given a string of letters. Find the maximum difference between the number of occurences of two letters such that the bigger one is odd and the lower even.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**
    In order to maximize the difference we must find the biggest letter with odd frequency and the smallest letter with even frequency.
- **What approach did I use and why?**
    We use a vector of size 26 to store frequency of each letter. We then go through the vector to find the biggest odd number and the smallest even number and finally returnt the differnce.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDifference(string s) {
        vector<int> mp(26,0);
        int odd = -1;
        int even = INT_MAX;
        for (const char c : s) {
            mp[c-'a']++;
        }
        for (auto i : mp) {
            if (i%2==0) {
                even = even>i&&!(i==0)?i:even;
            } else {
                odd = odd<i?i:odd;
            }
        }
        return odd-even;
    }
};
```
