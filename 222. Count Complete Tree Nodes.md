## Problem: [222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Binary Search | Bit Manipulation | Binary Tree | Tree*

---

### Description:
Given the root of a binary tree, return the count of total elements in it with a time complexity of less than O(log n).

---

### Approach:
Used a height-based binary tree property:
- If left and right subtree heights are equal, the left subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h, so it has 2^h - 1 nodes + root = 2^h
- Otherwise, the right subtree is a perfect binary tree of height h-1
Repeatedly apply this recursively to get total node count.
- **Time Complexity:** O(log^2 n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return 0;

        int leftHeight = getHeight(root->left);
        int rightHeight = getHeight(root->right);

        if (leftHeight == rightHeight) {
            return (1 << leftHeight) + countNodes(root->right);
        } else {
            return (1 << rightHeight) + countNodes(root->left);
        }
    }

private:
    int getHeight(TreeNode* node) {
        int h = 0;
        while (node) {
            node = node->left;
            h++;
        }
        return h;
    }
};
```
