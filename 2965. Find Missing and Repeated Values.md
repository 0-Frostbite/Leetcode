## Problem: [2965. Find Missing and Repeated Values](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-missing-and-repeated-values/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Hash Table | Matrix | Math*

---

### Description:
Given a NxN matrix with number between 1 and N^2. A number is missing and a number is present 2 times, return both the numbers.

---

### Approach:
Flattened the 2D grid logically by mapping values into a 1D frequency array. Used the expected sum formula to identify the missing value by subtracting actual sum from the ideal total and adjusting with the repeated number. This is optimal in both time and space for fixed-size grid.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findMissingAndRepeatedValues(vector<vector<int>>& grid) {
        int n = grid.size();
        int total = n * n;
        vector<int> freq(total, 0);
        int sum = 0, repeated = -1;

        for (const auto& row : grid) {
            for (int num : row) {
                sum += num;
                if (++freq[num - 1] == 2) repeated = num;
            }
        }

        int expectedSum = total * (total + 1) / 2;
        int missing = expectedSum - (sum - repeated);
        return {repeated, missing};
    }
};
```
