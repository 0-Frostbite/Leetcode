## Problem: [100. Same Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/same-tree/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Tree | DFS | BFS | Binary Tree*

---

### Description:
Given the roots of two binary trees tell if they are the same or not.

---

### Approach:
Check if the left and right nodes of both the trees exist and have the same values. Compare the left and both trees and right of both trees.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), because we explore all the nodes of the shortest binary tree and compare them and not O(2^n) as we are not exploring all possible combiations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), height of tree because of recursion stack.

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool isSameTree(TreeNode* p, TreeNode* q) {
        if (!(p || q)) return true;
        if (!(p && q)) return false;
        if (p->val!=q->val) return false;
        return isSameTree(p->left,q->left) && isSameTree(p->right,q->right);
    }
};
```
