## Problem: [3227. Vowels Game in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/vowels-game-in-a-string/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Math | String | Game Theory | Brainteaser*

### Description:
Given a string s. On Alice's turn, she has to remove any non-empty
from s that contains an odd number of vowels. On Bob's turn, he has to remove any non-empty substring that contains an even number of vowels. The first player who cannot make a move on their turn loses the game. Return true if Alice wins the game, and false otherwise.

---

### Approach:
The only way for Alice to not win is if the string has no vowels because if there are odd number of vowels Alice wins and if there are even number of vowels say 6, she picks 5 and 6 - 5 gives 1. It is not possible for Bob to play 1 therefore Alice wins.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool doesAliceWin(string s) {
        for (auto c : s) {
            if (c == 'a' || c == 'e' || c == 'i' || c == 'o' || c == 'u') {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
};
```
