## Problem: [1394. Find Lucky Integer in an Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-lucky-integer-in-an-array/)

### Difficulty:
*Easy*

### Topics:
*Array | Hash Table | Counting*

---

### Description:
Given an Array of intergers find the highest number such that the numbers occurences is equal to the number.

---

### Approach:
There are two methods to solve this question -
   - Using a Hash Map to store the frequency of each number and output the highest valid number.
   - Sort the Array in ascending order, count and check for the number.
Since the given constraint is very small (500) the approach doesnt matter however for a very large input size Hash Map is the best option.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) (HashMap) | O(n.log(n)) (Sorting``)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) (HashMap) | O(1) (Sorting)

---

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int findLucky(vector<int>& arr) {
        int lucky = -1;
        vector<int> map(500,0);
        for (auto i : arr) {
            map[i-1]++;
        }
        for (int i=0 ; i<map.size() ; i++) {
            if (i+1 == map[i]) lucky = max(lucky,i+1);
        }
        return lucky;
    }
};
```
