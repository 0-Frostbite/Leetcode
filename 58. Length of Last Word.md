```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int lengthOfLastWord(string s) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = s.length() - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (s[i] != ' ') {
                count++;
            } else if (count > 0) {
                return count;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
