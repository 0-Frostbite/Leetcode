## Problem: [2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/insert-greatest-common-divisors-in-linked-list/)

### Difficulty:
*Medium*

### Topics:
*Linked List | Math | Number Theory*

---

### Description:
Find the GCD of the adjacent nodes in a linked list and insert it between them.

---

### Approach:
- **What did I think first?**
    The key operation and optimization here is in finding the GCD, insertion is basic logic.

- **What approach did I use and why?**
    The GCD is calculated using the Euclidean Algorithm which is the most optimal way of doing so.
    - Base Case: If one of the numbers is zero, the GCD is the other number.
    - Recursive Step: Otherwise, divide the larger number by the smaller number and replace the larger number with the remainder. Repeat this process until the remainder is zero.
    - GCD: The last non-zero remainder is the GCD
    The insertion was optimized by:
    - Using only one node pointer variable to store the current node (cur)
    - Calculating GCD and Inserting using only 1 line of code. Decreasing the number of calls.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * log(min(a, b)))
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Solution:
```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    ListNode* insertGreatestCommonDivisors(ListNode* head) {
        ListNode* cur = head;
        while (cur && cur->next) {
            cur->next = new ListNode(findGCD(cur->val, cur->next->val),cur->next);
            cur = cur->next->next; 
        }
        return head;
    }

    int findGCD(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            a %= b;
            std::swap(a, b);
        }
        return a;
    }
};
```
